# Computer-vision-for-Food-and-Dog
This repository contains ipynb files, in which food classification and dog breed classification is trained using computer vision. 
* In Food vision, I used EfficientNetB0 model for simplicity, which gained exceptionally well accuracy after a few epochs. I encourage you to train for more epochs, or unfreezing the last few layers to maximize the accuracy. In summary, this simple model multiplied by more training epochs and fine tuning will achieve incredible accuracy.
* In Dog vision, I used pretrained mobilenet-v2, which also gained incredible accuracy in a few epochs. I also encourage you to train for more epochs to see better accuracy. Also you can plot the model prediction to see in which image the model predicts well and poor, by which you can engineer the data to maximize the accuracy. The plotting of model prediction is provided to you.
* You can access the data throug this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ph-E1RlBi_FTR-2gOLXXC11DGCzJ8RhS?usp=sharing
